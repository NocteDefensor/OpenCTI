# Using Portainer
---

## Navigation

1. Navigate to Portainer by entering `Http://YourIp:19000`
    - Replace "YourIP" with the public IP address of your the Manager node if using a cloud based VM.
    - If the host that you are browsing from is in the same subnet as your docker swarm nodes(i.e you are standing this up on prem or have a vpn tunnel to the cloud subnet) then you can replace YourIP with the private IP of the manager node.
